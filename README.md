## Some mumblings about colors

- black - yellow = black            (#00.00.00 - #ff.ff.00 = #00.00.00)
- gray - yellow =   dark blue       (#80.80.80 + #ff.ff.00 = #00.00.80)
- light blue - yellow = blue        (#80.80.ff - #ff.ff.00 = #00.00.ff)

- black + yellow = yellow           (#00.00.00 - #ff.ff.00 = #ff.ff.00)
- gray + yellow =   light yellow    (#80.80.80 + #ff.ff.00 = #ff.ff.80)
- light blue + yellow = white       (#80.80.ff - #ff.ff.00 = #ff.ff.ff)
